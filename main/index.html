Hello!

Glad to see you're examining my code, I would expect nothing less.
You'll see some (what I'd like to consider) tidy code, of course there
will be flaws, I'm only human, but I hope what I have here pleases you!

Thank you,
Trent S.

  	<h4 style="text-align: left;">

  	Hello! My name is Trent, I'm 17 from Lorain County, Ohio and 
  	I am a Tech Repairman and a Cyber-Security Student. I have 
  	expansive knowledge of Python, JavaScript, and VBS as well 
  	as CAD Software. I love all things IT and build and resell 
  	PC's on the side. My main goal is to aid in cyber security 
  	for those who are most vulnerable such as small businesses, 
  	schools, etc.

      <h1 style="font-size: 40;">Experience</h1>

      <h4 style="text-align: left;">
      	
         My experience with technology began fairly early on, seeing as to
         my fathers career as a support specialist. At age 7 my father had
         taught me how Random Access Memory worked and ever since I've been
         in love. In 7th grade I took a python class my middle school was
         offering and from there I just kept learning more and more.

      <h4 style="text-align: center; padding-right: 300px; padding-left: 300px;">
      	
      	My prior IT work experience consists of several personal projects but also
      	some professional experience such as my work with NRCS. For NRCS I worked
      	as a Tech Dept. Aide, essentially meaning my job was to help around and my 
      	primary function was to just learn how the IT field works. I was tasked 
      	with imaging laptops, sorting through upwards of 1500 chromebooks and setting 
      	up desktops in various places throughout the schools in the district.
